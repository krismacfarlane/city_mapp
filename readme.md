# City Mapps

This is a RESTful web application that is built using Rails. The main idea behind it is for city natives to create a map of city highlights that they enjoy. When tourists come to the city, they can use this app to check out areas that locals recommend, so they avoid tourist traps!

**User stories**

A user can:
  - log-in using Facebook
  - choose a city from a U.S. map (NYC only to start)
  - see a list of names of maps for that specified city
  - see a list of name of maps that they've created
  - create a new map using a city basemap
  - delete a map that they've created
  - [publish their map to facebook -- in the far off future, probably]
